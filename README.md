Problem :- There is a lack of personalized and accessible career guidance for secondary-level students, aiming to overcome limited resources, outdated information, unequal access, aptitude mismatches, and the impact of globalization and technological advances.
Solution :- Making career choices and AI based counselling accessible to every child at secondary level along with aptitude tests and detailed career paths.
